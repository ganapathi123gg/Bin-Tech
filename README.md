BINTECH is a project that aims to address the escalating plastic waste issue by implementing a plastic identification and recycling system. The project utilizes a combination of front-end technologies (HTML, CSS, JavaScript), back-end development (Python, Flask, OpenCV), machine learning (sklearn), and hardware components (Arduino board, LEDs). The system encourages individuals to deposit plastic into designated dustbins equipped with intelligent identification mechanisms. When a plastic is placed in the dustbin, an image is captured and processed using computer vision techniques. Machine learning algorithms, particularly the Conventional neural network (CNN) function, classify the image as a plastic or non-plastic item. LED lights provide feedback on the identification process, and upon successful identification, a QR code is generated. Users can scan the QR code using a mobile app, converting it into recycling points for future use. The project aims to promote environmental protection by incentivizing individuals to actively participate in recycling efforts.
